# Trellis Brainstorm

## Non-Negotiable Planning Contract

A request to build, implement, fix, refactor, or "go ahead" is not approval to leave planning. Task-creation consent is also not implementation approval.

For every non-trivial task, the user must respond at least once after the initial request before implementation begins. If no clarification is needed, that response must approve the final planning summary described below.

While any user-owned product, scope, UX, compatibility, risk, or acceptance decision remains unresolved, keep the task in planning. First inventory evidence and decision dependencies. If at least two independent material decisions remain and `pennix-decision-grill` is available, delegate one bounded batch of up to three frontier questions; otherwise ask the single highest-value question. Do not edit product code, dispatch implementation, or run `task.py start` until the decision chain is sealed.

## Analysis-Only Exception

When `task.json.meta.delivery_mode = "analysis_only"` exactly and the PRD names a bounded evidence deliverable plus a no-change boundary for product source, runtime configuration, deployment, credentials, and external systems, task-creation consent authorizes that evidence work. Do not require a second planning approval or run `task.py start`: perform the declared research, audit, or design work while status remains `planning`, record the evidence, verify acceptance criteria and the boundary, commit task artifacts, and archive directly. If the evidence recommends a protected-target change, record it and create a separate change-bearing task before doing it.

This exception is eligible only for a bounded evidence deliverable with no material user decision, design or implementation plan, cross-owner coordination, security or deployment change, release or credential action, or protected downstream task. Calling work "research", deferring source edits, or working in an audit/root repository does not make it analysis-only. If any of those conditions apply, use the normal complex planning and implementation-approval path.

All other tasks follow the planning and implementation approval gates below.

## Non-Negotiable Evidence Rule

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

This is mandatory. Before asking the user a question, first check whether the answer is already available in code, tests, configs, docs, existing specs, or task history.

Do not ask the user to confirm facts that the repository can answer. Ask only for product intent, preference, scope, risk tolerance, acceptance behavior, or decisions that remain ambiguous after inspection.

Repository evidence establishes current behavior and technical constraints. The user's intended behavior, feature scope boundaries, and UX preferences are never answerable by repository evidence alone, even when an existing pattern exists; existing patterns are options and recommendation evidence, not decisions.

## Evidence Units For Read-Heavy Work

When research, audit, review, or investigation is too large to leave one independently useful conclusion in the current bounded session, split it into evidence units. Each unit must have one question or scope, a minimal evidence range, a destination artifact, and a stop condition; write its facts, conclusion or blocker, unknowns, and recovery point before starting another unit. Size units so one normal context window can finish and persist one useful result; do not promise an exact token or time limit. Routine navigation and transient tool output do not need an artifact. Create a child task only when the unit has an independent owner, lifecycle, and acceptance contract.

Persist the unit-to-point mapping in this task's existing plan/matrix before
dispatch. Include workload rationale, dependencies, minimal evidence, shared
context, and per-point delivery. Combine points only when each is quick/simple
and they are obviously related; explain the grouping and bounded total workload.
Complex or lengthy points need separate units or further splitting. Slots and
owner domains do not determine unit count. Explicit independent subnodes use
`trellis-channel`'s unit-plan and multi-target procedure; planning itself does
not authorize dispatch.

Use this skill during Phase 1 planning to turn the user's request into clear requirements and planning artifacts.

## Preconditions

Use this skill only after task-creation consent has been given and the user is ready to enter Trellis planning.

If no task exists yet, create one:

```bash
TASK_DIR=$(python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<short task title>" --description "<one-line summary>" --slug <slug>)
```

Use a concise title from the user's request. Both the title and `--description` must be non-empty — `create` rejects blanks, and a record with either one empty is refused at archive. Use a slug without a date prefix. `task.py create` adds the `MM-DD-` directory prefix automatically.

`task.py create` creates the default `prd.md`. Update that file with the current understanding before asking follow-up questions.

## Planning Flow

1. Capture the user's request and initial known facts in `prd.md`.
2. Inspect available evidence before asking questions:
   - code, tests, fixtures, and configs
   - README files, docs, existing specs, and domain notes
   - related Trellis tasks, research files, and session history when present
3. Separate what you found into:
   - confirmed facts
   - product intent still needed from the user
   - scope or risk decisions still needed from the user
   - likely out-of-scope items
4. If user-owned decisions remain, calculate the independent frontier. Use `pennix-decision-grill` for a bounded batch when two or more independent material decisions are ready; otherwise ask the single highest-value question. Include recommendation and trade-off. Yield only while the answer is unavailable.
5. When the host returns the current continuation's answer, immediately persist it in `prd.md` or the decision artifact, recheck evidence and conflicts, recalculate the frontier, and continue the same planning loop. Do not create a second Trellis lifecycle for the same decision chain. Stop only for a new unresolved frontier, a real capability or authority block, or a final sealed summary awaiting implementation approval.
6. When no user-owned decision remains, create or update `design.md` and `implement.md` for complex tasks.
7. Run the requirement convergence gate, then the PRD convergence pass. Finish with one Planning Seal closure pass.
8. Present the final planning summary and stop. Do not run `task.py start` or edit product code in the same turn.
9. For planned/change-bearing tasks, classify `execution_class=planned` and `delivery_mode=change_bearing` in native task meta, then run `task.py plan seal <task>` after closure. Only a subsequent user message explicitly approving this task's current material plan authorizes `task.py plan approve <task> --revision <n> --basis "<short non-sensitive actual approval basis>"`, followed by `task.py start` and implementation. Initial delivery requests, parent-task approval, and design answers are insufficient. If scope, owner, risk, public behavior, or acceptance materially changes, run `task.py replan <task> "<reason>"`; it invalidates seal/approval. Return through planning, seal the new revision, present it, and obtain later approval. Minor wording, formatting, and progress records do not require resealing. The native record enforces structure, not authenticity of chat approval.

When changing the active task only for planning, use native `task.py select`,
not start. `create --no-start` intentionally preserves the old pointer. Follow
the Channel drain procedure before switching with live evidence workers.

Do not invent a project-specific product/spec hierarchy. If the repository already has product, domain, or spec docs, use them. If it does not, proceed with the evidence that exists.

## Question Rules

Ask one bounded batch per message: include up to three independent material frontier questions. Ask exactly one question only when it is the sole remaining material decision or later decisions depend on its answer.

Each question must include:

- the decision needed
- why the answer matters
- your recommended answer
- the trade-off if the user chooses differently

Do not ask process questions such as whether to search, inspect files, or continue brainstorming. Do the evidence work directly. Ask the user only when the remaining issue is a product decision, preference, scope boundary, or risk tolerance choice.

Recommendations are not default selections. Never choose a recommended product decision on the user's behalf merely because the user asked for implementation.

Do not manufacture clarification questions when the request and repository evidence already resolve every decision. In that case, proceed directly to the final planning summary, which still requires a subsequent explicit approval.

The final review is a required phase-transition gate, not a prohibited process question. Task-creation consent, the initial implementation request, and approval given before the latest final summary do not satisfy this gate.

## Thinking Framework: First Principles Analysis

When requirements are vague, solutions feel over-engineered, or you're about to add complexity "because everyone does" — decompose to fundamental truths before reasoning upward.

### Step 1: Restate the Problem

Strip away implementation details to one sentence.

> Bad: "We need to add Redis caching to the user profile endpoint"
> Good: "User profile data takes too long to load"

### Step 2: List Fundamental Truths

What is absolutely true (not opinion or convention)?

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Physical constraints** | Network latency ≥ 0, disk I/O has limits |
| **Business rules** | "Users must see their own data" |
| **Technical invariants** | "Data must be consistent" |
| **User needs** | "The user wants X within Y seconds" |

### Step 3: Challenge Assumptions

For each component of the current plan:

- **Fact or convention?** "We always use REST" — why?
- **What if we removed this?** If nothing breaks, it's unnecessary.
- **Solving the actual problem or a symptom?** Trace the causal chain.
- **Who benefits from this complexity?** If "nobody", simplify.

### Step 4: Build Up from Truths

1. Start with the minimum viable mechanism satisfying all truths
2. Add complexity only when a specific truth demands it
3. Each addition must answer: "Which truth requires this?"

### Step 5: Validate

- Does the solution solve the original problem?
- What assumptions need verification?
- What's the simplest experiment to test this?

## Requirement Convergence Gate

Before final review, verify all of the following:

- the user outcome and product value are explicit
- in-scope and out-of-scope behavior are explicit
- acceptance criteria describe observable outcomes
- user-owned product, scope, UX, compatibility, and risk decisions are resolved
- blocking open questions are empty
- technical unknowns are researched or explicitly deferred without changing MVP behavior

Lightweight tasks may omit `design.md` and `implement.md`; they may not skip evidence inspection, requirement convergence, final review, or fresh implementation approval.

The final planning summary must show Goal, In Scope, Out of Scope, Acceptance Criteria, Key Decisions, relevant Risks or Deferred Items, and artifact status.

The Planning Seal closure pass must reconcile `task.json`, `prd.md`, `design.md`, `implement.md`, research, decision records, and manifests; verify the actual modification targets and branches, ordered dependencies and release steps, validation and rollback, dynamic-fact dispositions and replan triggers, and that every material decision has an owner and a fixed outcome. Remove static ambiguity before implementation: no `TBD`, `TODO`, `decision-needed`, unowned option, unspecified branch, open implementation path, validation gap, or conditional acceptance may remain. A material discovery invalidates the seal and returns to planning; implementation may consume only a sealed plan.

## Artifact Rules

`prd.md` records requirements and acceptance:

- goal and user value
- confirmed facts
- requirements
- acceptance criteria
- out of scope
- open questions that still block planning

`design.md` records technical design for complex tasks:

- architecture and boundaries
- data flow and contracts
- compatibility and migration notes
- important trade-offs
- operational or rollback considerations

`implement.md` records execution planning for complex tasks:

- ordered implementation checklist
- validation commands
- risky files or rollback points
- follow-up checks before `task.py start`

Lightweight tasks may have only `prd.md`. Complex tasks must have `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start`.

`implement.md` is not a replacement for `implement.jsonl`. On sub-agent-dispatch workflows, `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` must each contain at least one real spec/research entry before `task.py start`; an empty manifest, or one holding only a legacy `_example` placeholder row, does not count. Inline workflows skip this JSONL gate because Phase 2 loads context through `trellis-before-dev`.

## PRD Convergence Pass

Before declaring planning ready or running `task.py start`, rewrite `prd.md` once against the final structure described in the artifact rules above. This is not optional cleanup; it is the final planning gate.

The pass must be lossless:

- Collapse repeated facts into one authoritative section.
- Fold temporary brainstorm sections such as `What I already know`, `Assumptions`, and resolved `Open Questions` into Goal, Background, Requirements, Technical Notes, or Acceptance Criteria.
- Remove resolved open questions instead of leaving empty or already-answered sections.
- Merge parallel bug and requirement lists when they describe the same work; keep each defect's severity, evidence, and file:line anchors on the owning requirement.
- Preserve every file:line anchor, decision, constraint, requirement ID, and acceptance-criteria mapping.
- Do not proceed to final review while any blocking open question remains.

After the pass, read `prd.md` top to bottom and verify that no fact is repeated across sections unless the repetition adds new information.

## Quality Bar

Before declaring planning ready:

- `prd.md` contains testable acceptance criteria.
- `prd.md` has passed the PRD convergence pass: no unresolved temporary brainstorm sections, no duplicate facts across sections, and no lost anchors, decisions, or acceptance mappings.
- Repository-answerable questions have already been answered through inspection.
- Blocking open questions are empty.
- Complex tasks have `design.md` and `implement.md`.
- Sub-agent-dispatch tasks have real curated entries in both `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl`; seed-only manifests are not ready.
- The latest final planning summary has been presented to the user.
- In a subsequent message, the user explicitly approved that summary for implementation.

Do not start implementation merely because the user originally asked for implementation.
