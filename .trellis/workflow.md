# Development Workflow

---

## Core Principles

1. **Plan before code** — figure out what to do before you start
2. **Specs injected, not remembered** — guidelines are injected via hook/skill, not recalled from memory
3. **Persist everything** — research, decisions, and lessons all go to files; conversations get compacted, files don't
4. **Incremental development** — one task at a time
5. **Capture learnings** — after each task, review and write new knowledge back to spec

---

## Trellis System

### Developer Identity

On first use, initialize your identity:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/init_developer.py <your-name>
```

Creates `.trellis/.developer` (gitignored) + `.trellis/workspace/<your-name>/`.

### Spec System

`.trellis/spec/` holds coding guidelines organized by package and layer.

- `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` — entry point with **Pre-Development Checklist** + **Quality Check**. Actual guidelines live in the `.md` files it points to.
- `.trellis/spec/guides/index.md` — cross-package thinking guides.

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages   # list packages / layers
```

**When to update spec**: new pattern/convention found · bug-fix prevention to codify · new technical decision.

### Task System

Every task has its own directory under `.trellis/tasks/{MM-DD-name}/` holding `task.json`, `prd.md`, optional `design.md`, optional `implement.md`, optional `research/`, and optional context manifests (`implement.jsonl`, `check.jsonl`) for explicitly briefed channel workers.

```bash
# Task lifecycle
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<title>" [--slug <name>] [--parent <dir>]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <name>          # set active task (session-scoped when available)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source      # show active task and source
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py finish                # clear active task (triggers after_finish hooks)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py archive <name>        # move to archive/{year-month}/
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list [--mine] [--status <s>]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-archive

# Optional code-spec context for Trellis channel workers. The coordinator
# curates the manifests before passing them with `trellis channel spawn --jsonl`.
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context <name> <action> <file> <reason>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-context <name> [action]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py validate <name>

# Task metadata
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-branch <name> <branch>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-base-branch <name> <branch>    # PR target
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-scope <name> <scope>

# Hierarchy (parent/child)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>

# PR creation
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create-pr [name] [--dry-run]
```

> Run `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py --help` to see the authoritative, up-to-date list.

**Current-task mechanism**: `task.py create` creates the task directory and (when session identity is available) auto-sets the per-session active-task pointer so the planning breadcrumb fires immediately. `task.py start` writes the same pointer (idempotent if already set) and flips `task.json.status` from `planning` to `in_progress`. State is stored under `.trellis/.runtime/sessions/`. If no context key is available from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or a platform-native session environment variable, there is no active task and `task.py start` fails with a session identity hint. `task.py finish` deletes the current session file (status unchanged). `task.py archive <task>` writes `status=completed`, moves the directory to `archive/`, and deletes any runtime session files that still point at the archived task.

### Workspace System

Records every AI session for cross-session tracking under `.trellis/workspace/<developer>/`.

- `journal-N.md` — session log. **Max 2000 lines per file**; a new `journal-(N+1).md` is auto-created when exceeded.
- `index.md` — personal index (total sessions, last active).

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/add_session.py --title "Title" --commit "hash" --summary "Summary"
```

### Context Script

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py                            # full session runtime
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages            # available packages + spec layers
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <X.Y>  # detailed guide for a workflow step
```

<!--
  WORKFLOW-STATE BREADCRUMB CONTRACT (read this before editing the tag blocks below)

  The [workflow-state:STATUS] blocks embedded in the ## Phase Index section
  below are the SINGLE source of truth for the per-turn `<workflow-state>`
  breadcrumb that every supported AI platform's UserPromptSubmit hook
  reads. inject-workflow-state.py (Python platforms) and
  inject-workflow-state.js (OpenCode plugin) only parse them — there is no
  fallback dict baked into the scripts after v0.5.0-rc.0.

  STATUS charset: [A-Za-z0-9_-]+. When the hook can't find a tag, it
  degrades to a generic "Refer to workflow.md for current step." line —
  intentionally visible so users notice and fix a broken workflow.md.

  INVARIANT (test/regression.test.ts):
    Every workflow-walkthrough step marked `[required · once]` must have a
    matching enforcement line in its phase's [workflow-state:*] block. The
    breadcrumb is the only per-turn channel; if a mandatory step isn't
    mentioned there, the AI silently skips it (Phase 1 planning gate
    skip and Phase 3.4 commit skip both manifested via this gap).

  TAG ↔ PHASE scoping:
    [workflow-state:no_task]      → no active task; before Phase 1
    [workflow-state:planning]     → all of Phase 1 (status='planning')
    [workflow-state:planning-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 1
    [workflow-state:in_progress]  → Phase 2 + Phase 3.2-3.4
                                    (status stays 'in_progress' from
                                    task.py start until task.py archive)
    [workflow-state:in_progress-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 2/3
    [workflow-state:completed]    → currently DEAD: cmd_archive flips
                                    status and moves the dir in the same
                                    call, so the resolver loses the
                                    pointer (block kept for a future
                                    explicit in_progress→completed
                                    transition)

  Editing checklist:
    - When you change a [workflow-state:STATUS] block, also check the
      matching phase's `[required · once]` walkthrough steps for sync
    - Run `trellis update` after editing to push the new bodies to
      downstream user projects (block-level managed replacement)
    - Full runtime contract:
      .trellis/spec/cli/backend/workflow-state-contract.md
-->

## Phase Index

```
Phase 1: Plan    → classify, get task-creation consent, then write planning artifacts
Phase 2: Execute → implement only after task status is in_progress
Phase 3: Finish  → verify, update spec, commit, and wrap up
```

### Request Triage

- Simple conversation or small task: ask only whether this turn should create a Trellis task. If the user says no, skip Trellis for this session.
- Complex task: ask whether you may create a Trellis task and enter planning. If the user says no, do not do broad inline implementation; explain, clarify scope, or suggest a smaller split.
- User approval to create a task is not approval to start implementation. Planning still happens first.

### Planning Artifacts

- `prd.md` — requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Do not put technical design or execution checklists here.
- `design.md` — technical design for complex tasks: boundaries, contracts, data flow, tradeoffs, compatibility, rollout / rollback shape.
- `implement.md` — execution plan for complex tasks: ordered checklist, validation commands, review gates, and rollback points.
- `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` — optional spec and research manifests for explicitly briefed Trellis channel workers. They do not replace `implement.md`.
- Lightweight tasks may be PRD-only. Complex tasks must have `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start`.

### Parent / Child Task Trees

Use a parent task when one user request contains several independently verifiable deliverables. The parent task owns the source requirement set, the task map, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review; it normally should not be the implementation target unless it also has direct work.

Use child tasks for deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently. Parent/child structure is not a dependency system: if one child must wait for another, write that ordering in the child `prd.md` / `implement.md` and keep each child's acceptance criteria testable.

Create new children with `task.py create "<title>" --slug <name> --parent <parent-dir>`. Link existing tasks with `task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>`, and unlink mistakes with `task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>`.

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown when there is no active task (before Phase 1) -->

[workflow-state:no_task]
No active task. First classify the current turn and ask for task-creation consent before creating any Trellis task.
Simple conversation / small task: ask only whether this turn should create a Trellis task. If the user says no, skip Trellis for this session.
Complex task: ask the user if you can create a Trellis task and enter the planning phase. If the user says no, explain, clarify scope, or suggest a smaller split.
[/workflow-state:no_task]

[workflow-state:unbound_task]
An existing developer-owned task has no direct session binding. Inspect native `task.py current --json`: a non-null `session_source` means direct identity is already available; an unbound source still means no task binding. Select the existing task from the user's explicit intent; do not guess or create a duplicate. Resume its planning/status gates first. Run native `task.py start <task>` only when its activation contract permits it, after the Planning Seal and implementation authorization for a planning change-bearing task. An eligible `analysis_only` task stays in planning without start. If identity is absent, report that separately; never invent an identity or edit runtime pointers.
[/workflow-state:unbound_task]

[workflow-state:unbound_ambiguous]
Multiple developer-owned tasks have no direct session binding. Inspect native `task.py current --json`: a non-null `session_source` means direct identity is already available; an unbound source still means no task binding. Select the existing task from the user's explicit intent; do not guess or create a duplicate. Resume its planning/status gates first. Run native `task.py start <task>` only when its activation contract permits it, after the Planning Seal and implementation authorization for a planning change-bearing task. An eligible `analysis_only` task stays in planning without start. If identity is absent, report that separately; never invent an identity or edit runtime pointers.

### Phase 1: Plan
- 1.0 Create task `[required · once]` (only after task-creation consent)
- 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]` (`prd.md`; complex tasks also need `design.md` + `implement.md`)
- 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`
- 1.3 Configure context `[required · once]` — skip for inline work; prepare explicit files only before a Trellis channel worker is spawned
- 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]` (review gate, then `task.py start`; status → in_progress)
- 1.5 Completion criteria

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown throughout Phase 1 (status='planning') -->

[workflow-state:planning]
Load `trellis-brainstorm`; stay in planning.
Lightweight: `prd.md` can be enough. Complex: finish `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md`; ask for review before `task.py start`.
Multi-deliverable scope: consider a parent task plus independently verifiable child tasks; dependencies must be written in child artifacts, not implied by tree position.
Channel mode: curate `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` only when a Trellis channel worker needs explicit spec or research context.
[/workflow-state:planning]

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown throughout Phase 1 when codex.dispatch_mode=inline. -->

[workflow-state:planning-inline]
Load `trellis-brainstorm`; stay in planning.
Lightweight: `prd.md` can be enough. Complex: finish `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md`; ask for review before `task.py start`.
Multi-deliverable scope: consider a parent task plus independently verifiable child tasks; dependencies must be written in child artifacts, not implied by tree position.
Inline mode: skip jsonl curation; Phase 2 reads artifacts/specs via `trellis-before-dev`.
[/workflow-state:planning-inline]

### Phase 2: Execute
- 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress'.
     Scope: all of Phase 2 + Phase 3.2-3.4 (status stays 'in_progress' from
     task.py start until task.py archive; only archive flips it). The body
     therefore must cover every required step from implementation through
     commit, including Phase 3.3 spec update and Phase 3.4 commit. -->

Delegation policy: this project uses no native Codex subagents. Only the main coordinator may delegate, and it must use `trellis channel`. Each worker receives an explicit `Active task: <task path from task.py current>` briefing plus the exact task artifacts and manifests required for its bounded assignment.

[workflow-state:in_progress]
Flow: `trellis-before-dev` -> edit -> `trellis-check` -> validation -> `trellis-update-spec` -> commit (Phase 3.4) -> `/trellis:finish-work`.
For a bounded independent investigation or review, the coordinator may use `trellis channel spawn`; native agents remain prohibited.
[/workflow-state:in_progress]

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress' when codex.dispatch_mode=inline. -->

[workflow-state:in_progress-inline]
Flow: `trellis-before-dev` -> edit -> `trellis-check` -> validation -> `trellis-update-spec` -> commit (Phase 3.4) -> `/trellis:finish-work`.
Do not dispatch native Codex agents. When independent work is justified, the coordinator alone uses `trellis channel` and provides explicit task context.
Read context: `prd.md` -> `design.md if present` -> `implement.md if present`, plus relevant spec/research loaded by skills.
[/workflow-state:in_progress-inline]

### Phase 3: Finish
- 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`
- 3.3 Spec update `[required · once]`
- 3.4 Commit changes `[required · once]`
- 3.5 Wrap-up reminder

> Note: step 3.1 was folded into 2.2 (last-iteration full-scope check) and 3.4 (commit preamble). Numbering kept stable to avoid breaking external references.

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='completed'.
     Currently DEAD in normal flow: cmd_archive writes status='completed' in
     the same call that moves the task dir to archive/, so the active-task
     resolver loses the pointer and the hook never fires on archived tasks.
     Block preserved for a future status-transition redesign (e.g. an
     explicit in_progress→completed command). Edit through the same spec
     channel as the live blocks. -->

[workflow-state:completed]
Code committed. Run `/trellis:finish-work`; if dirty, return to Phase 3.4 first.
[/workflow-state:completed]

### Rules

1. Identify which Phase you're in, then continue from the next step there
2. Run steps in order inside each Phase; `[required]` steps can't be skipped
3. Phases can roll back (e.g., Execute reveals a prd defect → return to Plan to fix, then re-enter Execute)
4. Steps tagged `[once]` are skipped if the output already exists; don't re-run
5. Artifact presence informs the next step; missing `design.md` / `implement.md` is valid for lightweight tasks and incomplete planning for complex tasks.

### Active Task Routing

When a user request matches one of these intents inside an active task, route
first, then load the detailed phase step if needed.

- Planning or unclear requirements -> `trellis-brainstorm`.
- Before editing -> `trellis-before-dev`; after editing -> `trellis-check`.
- Repeated debugging -> `trellis-break-loop`; spec updates -> `trellis-update-spec`.
- Independent research or review -> the coordinator may use `trellis channel`.

Native Codex subagents are disabled. The coordinator is the only role allowed
to delegate, and channel workers must receive an explicit active-task path and
bounded assignment.

### Guardrails

- Task creation approval is not implementation approval; implementation waits for `task.py start` after artifact review.
- PRD-only is valid for lightweight tasks; complex tasks need `design.md` + `implement.md`.
- Planning must be persisted to task artifacts; checks must run before reporting completion.

### Loading Step Detail

At each step, run this to fetch detailed guidance:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <step>
# e.g. python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step 1.1
```

---

## Phase 1: Plan

Goal: classify the request, get task-creation consent when a task is needed, and produce the planning artifacts required before implementation.

#### 1.0 Create task `[required · once]`

Create the task directory only after task-creation consent. The command sets status to `planning`, writes `task.json`, creates a default `prd.md`, and auto-targets the new task when session identity is available:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<task title>" --slug <name>
```

`--slug` is the human-readable name only. Do **not** include the `MM-DD-` date prefix; `task.py create` adds that prefix automatically.

For task trees, create the parent task first and then create each child with `--parent <parent-dir>`. Do not start the parent just because children exist; start the child that owns the next independently verifiable deliverable.

After this command succeeds, the per-turn breadcrumb auto-switches to the
inline planning state, telling the AI to stay in planning.

Run only `create` here — do not also run `start`. `start` flips status to `in_progress`, which switches the breadcrumb to the implementation phase before planning artifacts are reviewed. Save `start` for step 1.4.

Skip when `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source` already points to a task.

#### 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]`

Load the `trellis-brainstorm` skill and explore requirements interactively with the user per the skill's guidance.

The brainstorm skill will guide you to:
- Ask one question at a time
- Prefer researching over asking the user
- Prefer offering options over open-ended questions
- Update `prd.md` immediately after each user answer
- Split large scopes into a parent task plus child tasks when the deliverables can be verified independently
- Keep `prd.md` focused on requirements and acceptance criteria
- For complex tasks, produce `design.md` and `implement.md` before implementation starts

When considering a parent/child split:
- Use a parent task when one request contains several independently verifiable deliverables.
- Parent tasks own source requirements, child-task mapping, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review.
- Child tasks own actual deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently.
- Parent/child structure is not a dependency system. If child B depends on child A, write that ordering in child B's `prd.md` / `implement.md`.
- Start the child task that owns the next deliverable. Do not start the parent unless the parent itself has direct implementation work.

Return to this step whenever requirements change and revise the relevant artifact.

#### 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`

Research may use local source inspection or approved documentation lookup. In
inline mode, write durable findings into `{TASK_DIR}/research/` directly. If
an independent investigation is justified, the coordinator may spawn one
bounded worker through `trellis channel`; the worker must write its findings to
the same task directory and report back through the channel.

Record one file per topic, the evidence consulted, constraints discovered, and
the resulting decision or open risk. Do not use context-mode as project memory.

#### 1.3 Configure context `[required · once]`

Inline implementation and checks load task artifacts with
`trellis-before-dev` and `trellis-check`; no native Codex context injection is
available or required. Before a channel worker is spawned, the coordinator
must pass the active task path and only the exact `--file` / `--jsonl` context
needed for that worker. Keep task facts and findings in Trellis artifacts.

#### 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]`

After artifact review, flip the task status to `in_progress`:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <task-dir>
```

For lightweight tasks, `prd.md` can be enough. For complex tasks, `prd.md`,
`design.md`, and `implement.md` must exist and be reviewed before start.
Manifest files are required only when a channel worker is actually spawned;
inline work loads context through the project skills.

After this command succeeds, the breadcrumb auto-switches to
`[workflow-state:in_progress-inline]`, and the rest of Phase 2 / 3 follows.

If `task.py start` errors with a session-identity message, follow the hint in
the error to set up session identity, then retry.

#### 1.5 Completion criteria

| Condition | Required |
|------|:---:|
| `prd.md` exists | ✅ |
| User confirms task should enter implementation | ✅ |
| `task.py start` has been run (status = in_progress) | ✅ |
| `research/` has artifacts (complex tasks) | recommended |
| `design.md` exists (complex tasks) | ✅ |
| `implement.md` exists (complex tasks) | ✅ |

---

## Phase 2: Execute

Goal: turn reviewed planning artifacts into code that passes quality checks.

#### 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`

1. Load `trellis-before-dev` and read the active task artifacts.
2. Implement only the reviewed scope in the main session.
3. Run focused syntax, type, and offline tests after each coherent change.
4. Use `trellis channel` only when an independent worker is justified; the
   coordinator owns the worker prompt, context files, and integration.

#### 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`

Load `trellis-check` and review the full uncommitted scope against the task,
the relevant `.trellis/spec/` rules, and the required offline test matrix.
Fix findings in the main session, then repeat the checks until green. A
channel worker may provide an independent review only when the coordinator
briefs it explicitly and integrates its findings.

**Final pass (before Phase 3.4 commit)**: run the full affected-scope checks,
including every package listed by `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py
--mode packages` and each applicable spec index Quality Check section.

#### 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

- `check` reveals a prd defect → return to Phase 1, fix `prd.md`, then redo 2.1
- Implementation went wrong → revert code, redo 2.1
- Need more research → research (same as Phase 1.2), write findings into `research/`

---

## Phase 3: Finish

Goal: ensure code quality, capture lessons, record the work.

#### 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`

If this task involved repeated debugging (the same issue was fixed multiple times), load the `trellis-break-loop` skill to:
- Classify the root cause
- Explain why earlier fixes failed
- Propose prevention

The goal is to capture debugging lessons so the same class of issue doesn't recur.

#### 3.3 Spec update `[required · once]`

Load the `trellis-update-spec` skill and review whether this task produced new knowledge worth recording:
- Newly discovered patterns or conventions
- Pitfalls you hit
- New technical decisions

Update the docs under `.trellis/spec/` accordingly. Even if the conclusion is "nothing to update", walk through the judgment.

#### 3.4 Commit changes `[required · once]`

**Spec-sync preamble**: before drafting commits, ask: did this task fix a bug or surface non-obvious knowledge that should land in `.trellis/spec/` so future-you (or future-AI) doesn't repeat the mistake? If yes, return to Phase 3.3 first — spec writes belong in the same task's commit batch, not as a forgotten follow-up.

The AI drives a batched commit of this task's code changes so `/finish-work` can run cleanly afterwards. Goal: produce work commits FIRST, then bookkeeping (archive + journal) commits land after — never interleaved.

**Step-by-step**:

1. **Inspect dirty state**:
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   Snapshot every dirty path. If the working tree is clean, skip to 3.5.

2. **Learn commit style** from recent history (so drafted messages blend in):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```
   Note the prefix convention (`feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` / `docs:` ...), language (中文/English), and length style.

3. **Classify dirty files into two groups**:
   - **AI-edited this session** — files you wrote/edited via Edit/Write/Bash tool calls in this session. You know what changed and why.
   - **Unrecognized** — dirty files you did NOT touch this session (could be the user's manual edits, leftover WIP from a previous session, or unrelated work). Do NOT silently include these.

4. **Draft a commit plan**. Group AI-edited files into logical commits (1 commit per coherent change unit, not 1 commit per file). Each entry: `<commit message>` + file list. List unrecognized files separately at the bottom.

5. **Present the plan once, ask for one-shot confirmation**. Format:
   ```
   Proposed commits (in order):
     1. <message>
        - <file>
        - <file>
     2. <message>
        - <file>

   Unrecognized dirty files (NOT in any commit — confirm include/exclude):
     - <file>
     - <file>

   Reply 'ok' / '行' to execute. Reply with edits, or '我自己来' / 'manual' to abort.
   ```

6. **On confirmation**: run `git add <files>` + `git commit -m "<msg>"` for each batch in order. Do not amend. Do not push.

7. **On rejection** (user replies "不行" / "我自己来" / "manual" / any pushback on the plan): stop. Do not attempt a second plan. The user will commit by hand; you skip ahead to 3.5 once they confirm.

**Rules**:
- No `git commit --amend` anywhere — three-stage three-commit flow (work commits → archive commit → journal commit).
- Never push to remote in this step.
- If the user wants different message wording but accepts the file grouping, edit the message and re-confirm once — but if they reject the grouping, exit to manual mode.
- The batched plan is one prompt; do not prompt per commit.

#### 3.5 Wrap-up reminder

After the above, remind the user they can run `/finish-work` to wrap up (archive the task, record the session).

## Customizing Trellis (for forks)

This section is for developers who want to modify the Trellis workflow itself. All customization is done by editing this file; the scripts are parsers only.

### Changing what a step means

Edit the corresponding step's walkthrough body in the Phase 1 / 2 / 3 sections above. Critical invariants:
- No active task must triage first and ask for task-creation consent before creating a Trellis task.
- Planning must distinguish lightweight PRD-only tasks from complex tasks that require `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before start.
- Every required execution path must keep the Phase 3.4 commit reminder reachable before `/trellis:finish-work`.

All tag blocks live in the `## Phase Index` section above, immediately after each phase summary:

| Scope | Corresponding tag |
|---|---|
| No active task (before Phase 1) | `[workflow-state:no_task]` (after the Phase Index ASCII art) |
| All of Phase 1 (task created → ready for implementation) | `[workflow-state:planning]` (after Phase 1 summary) |

### Changing the per-turn prompt text

Directly edit the body of the corresponding `[workflow-state:STATUS]` block. After editing, run `trellis update` (if you're a template maintainer) or restart your AI session (if you're customizing your own project) — no script changes required.

### Adding a custom status

Add a new block:

```
[workflow-state:my-status]
your per-turn prompt text
[/workflow-state:my-status]
```

Constraints:
- STATUS charset: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` (underscores and hyphens allowed, e.g. `in-review`, `blocked-by-team`)
- A lifecycle hook must write `task.json.status` to your custom value, otherwise the tag is never read
- Lifecycle hooks live in `task.json.hooks.after_*` and bind to one of `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`

### Adding a lifecycle hook

Add a `hooks` field to your `task.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "after_finish": [
      "your-script-or-command-here"
    ]
  }
}
```

Supported events: `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`. Note that `after_finish` ≠ a status change (it only clears the active-task pointer); use `after_archive` for "task is done" notifications.

### Full contract

For the workflow state machine's runtime contract, the locations of all status writers, pseudo-statuses (`no_task` / `stale_<source_type>`), the hook reachability matrix, and other deep details, see:

- `.trellis/spec/cli/backend/workflow-state-contract.md` — runtime contract + writer table + test invariants
- `.trellis/scripts/inject-workflow-state.py` — actual parser (reads workflow.md only, no embedded text)
