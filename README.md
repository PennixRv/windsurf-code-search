# `@pennixrv/windsurf-code-search`

An on-demand Agent Skill and local CLI that asks Windsurf Devstral for bounded
semantic code-search candidates. Local `rg` and CodeGraph remain the default
path; this helper is for genuinely unknown locations or vague legacy behavior.

## Use

Pass an existing project directory. An explicit key remains supported for the
current process:

```bash
WINDSURF_API_KEY='provided-out-of-band' \
  npx --yes @pennixrv/windsurf-code-search \
  --project "/absolute/path/to/project" \
  --query "Where is the legacy import flow implemented?"
```

On Linux/WSL, when the current user has already completed Devin CLI login, the
same command may omit `WINDSURF_API_KEY`. The runtime then starts a bounded,
no-shell helper that reads only the fixed Devin CLI credentials file for that
user. It rejects symbolic links, oversized files, unknown fields and unsupported
formats, does not scan desktop state databases, and never exposes the token in
arguments, output, logs, or persistent state. Explicit `WINDSURF_API_KEY`
always has priority.

For a reusable local installation, configure the owner-managed private file
interactively:

```bash
windsurf-code-search configure
windsurf-code-search config-doctor
```

The file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/windsurf-code-search/config.json`, falling back
to `$HOME/.config/windsurf-code-search/config.json`. `configure` hides the key,
requires `REPLACE` before rotation, and writes `0700`/`0600` owner files. The
runtime precedence is environment, owner config, then Devin login. The doctor
prints only `status=configured|missing|invalid|blocked|unavailable` and never
contacts the remote service.

The accepted options are `--project`, `--query`, bounded `--max-results`,
repeatable relative `--deny`, standalone `--no-external`, and standalone
`--help`. `--no-external` exits with `FC_EXTERNAL_DISABLED` before inspecting
credentials, importing the remote core, or opening a network request. Missing
credentials produce `FC_KEY_MISSING`; `401/403`, timeout, transport or remote
capacity exhaustion, `5xx`, and malformed protocol responses use distinct fixed
`FC_*` diagnostics. The CLI never prints, stores, or logs credentials. It
rejects metadata, secrets, generated output, and paths outside the canonical
project root before any remote request.

Use the returned paths only as hints and verify them with local tools. A single
JSON result is emitted on stdout; fixed `FC_*` diagnostics are emitted on
stderr. No MCP server, registration, approval, whitelist, or global agent
configuration is required.

## Bounded coverage

Each invocation uses one monotonic deadline and one shared resource budget for
authentication, protocol requests, directory traversal, glob matching, `rg`
subprocesses, tool commands, and model rounds. Local enumeration limits visited
entries, directories, depth, files, matches, and output bytes. Child processes
run without a shell and are terminated and reaped when the caller cancels or
the deadline expires.

The live path performs one bounded `CheckUserMessageRateLimit` preflight after
JWT acquisition and before any repository map or answer/tool stream. It uses
the same remaining deadline and a fixed model identifier. A rejected preflight
stops before inspecting project files or opening the stream and remains a fixed
redacted `FC_*` failure.

When the stream reports a fixed transient capacity or availability rejection,
the client may retry that unchanged request at most twice within the same
deadline. This is not an additional model or tool round; malformed protocol,
authentication, timeout, output-limit, and server failures still stop safely.
If all three attempts end specifically in Connect `resource_exhausted`, the
client may refresh the JWT session and repeat its rate-limit preflight at most
twice before retrying the same current request. Session refreshes, backoff,
authentication, and every stream attempt consume the original invocation
deadline; they never create another tool turn or command.

For behavior queries, returned candidates prioritize locally read implementation
files; related tests are supplemental rather than a standalone substitute when
the implementation is available. Each bounded remote request permits at most
one fixed replacement for a malformed tool envelope; a second malformed
response for that request fails closed. Replacements do not add a logical tool
round or execute a command.
Before using that correction, the client may repair only known unquoted-key and
trailing-comma JSON defects inside the bounded `[TOOL_CALLS]...[ARGS]`
envelope, or recover complete top-level `command1` through `command4` objects
from a truncated `restricted_exec` envelope. A truncated `answer` envelope may
likewise recover only its first complete top-level JSON string value; the XML
inside that string still follows the normal strict parser and local projection.
It never extracts loose paths, commands, candidates, or prose from the rest of
a response, and no recovery relaxes local command, PathGuard, budget, or range
checks. An answer with neither candidate markers nor an exact no-result marker
gets one fixed answer-only shape correction under the shared deadline; a second
invalid shape remains `FC_PROTOCOL_INVALID`. That correction must produce at
least one locally projected candidate; an empty correction cannot erase the
prior nonempty malformed answer into `complete` with zero candidates.

For remote protocol grounding only, a successful guarded `readfile` result also
contains an internal `read_range` with the exact inclusive bounds of the
numbered rows it returned. The prompt requires a candidate range to copy those
bounds rather than estimate a line number, and candidate projection reopens the
file and validates the range again. `read_range` is not a public CLI JSON field;
it is absent for an empty read and never weakens PathGuard, output budgets, or
the final same-version range check.

Successful JSON uses `status: "complete"` or `status: "truncated"` and includes
local `coverage` counts, fixed reasons, and continuation information when
available. `complete` means the search exhausted the paths that PathGuard was
allowed to inspect within the named limits. It does not include denied paths
and does not prove semantic correctness or unrestricted whole-repository
coverage. `truncated` means the returned candidates may be incomplete; it is
never rendered as a conclusive `(no matches)` result.

The JSON `projection` object reports fixed counts only:
`remote_candidates`, `accepted_candidates`, `recovered_candidates`,
`rejected_candidates`, `unprocessed_candidates`, and fixed
`rejection_reasons`. Each exact `<range>` is one remote candidate unit, so a
single locally validated file may contribute more than one returned range.
`recovered_candidates` counts at most one primary non-test implementation range
recovered from this invocation's successfully executed local evidence and then
reopened through PathGuard. The first successful implementation `readfile` is
authoritative; an `rg` fallback is considered only when no implementation was
read or accepted. When the accepted result contains only tests, the client may
instead inspect bounded relative imports from at most four local test files and
resolve one guarded implementation, including standard `.js`-to-TypeScript
source mappings. Package imports, absolute paths, root escapes, missing files,
and arbitrary response prose are ignored. An `rg` fallback is considered only
after that local import path and ranks paths by bounded local match count. Such
a result is always `truncated` with `implementation_candidate_recovered`; it is
not reported as a native final answer candidate or as proof of semantic
correctness. `complete`
with zero candidates is valid only for the
exact `<no_results/>` marker or the established empty `<ANSWER></ANSWER>`
form. If any remote candidate fails local path/range projection, the result is
`truncated` with `coverage.reasons` containing
`remote_candidate_projection_rejected`; no remote XML, prose, rejected path, or
rejected range is emitted. A bounded answer-only correction cannot convert a
previously reported candidate into a complete empty result. A result-limit
frontier is likewise `truncated` and uses `candidate_result_limit` plus
`unprocessed_candidates`.

Candidate projection has three distinct trust boundaries. PathGuard first
revalidates canonical containment, deny rules, and symlink escapes. It then
opens the approved file and accepts only a 1-based range of at most 200 lines
that exists in one unchanged file version; empty files, EOF overflow, oversized
ranges, and files changed during validation are dropped without clamping.
Finally, callers must still inspect the returned source and decide whether it
actually satisfies the requested behavior. The fixed
`reason: "local_range_validated"` describes local path/range validation only,
not semantic correctness.

## Development

All checks are offline and use temporary fixtures or injected request runners:

```bash
npm test
npm run verify:provenance
npm run pack:check
npm pack --dry-run --json --ignore-scripts
node scripts/release/build-package.mjs --output dist/package-check
```

These commands do not call Windsurf, npm publication, GitHub, or any real
credential source.

The `test`, `release`, `release:verify`, and packaging-check scripts belong to
the source repository's maintainer workflow. They are intentionally omitted
from the installed consumer manifest; installation exposes only the runtime
CLI and Skill assets.
